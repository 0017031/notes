Paul Graham:

    Letâ€™s play that back one more time: we can make all these types of modifications without even looking at the rest of the code. This idea may sound alarmingly familiar to some readers. It is the recipe for spaghetti code.

    The object-oriented model makes it easy to build up programs by accretion. What this often means, in practice, is that it provides a structured way to write spaghetti code. This is not necessarily bad, but it is not entirely good either. [Ansi Common Lisp, Paul Graham, 1996, page 408]
